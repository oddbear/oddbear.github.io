Hello World...

My name is Oddbjørn U. Bakke, and I am a .Net developer from Norway.

I am nerd passionate about technology, and love (almost) anything I can get my hands on.

A good day for me, is a day that I learned something new.
If someone says something is impossible, I’d like to take that challenge for the test.
